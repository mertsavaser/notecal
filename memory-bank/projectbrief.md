## Project Brief

NoteCal is a Flutter mobile application that combines note‑taking with calendar functionality.

- **Primary goal**: Provide a smooth, Firebase‑backed experience for authenticated users to manage notes and calendar events.
- **Platforms**: Android and iOS (Flutter).
- **Data & Auth**: Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore.
- **Non‑goals**: The app itself is not a general Firebase example; Firebase is an implementation detail behind a clean Flutter UI.
