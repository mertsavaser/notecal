## Project Intelligence (.cursorrules)

- **Memory Bank**:
  - Always read all `memory-bank/*.md` files at the start of a task.
  - Keep `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` up to date after meaningful changes.
- **Testing preference**:
  - Do not skip or disable tests; fix root causes.
  - Prefer providing injection points (e.g., overridable `home` widget) so tests can avoid hitting real Firebase while keeping production logic unchanged.
- **Firebase**:
  - Production Firebase logic (auth, Firestore, onboarding helpers) should not be modified solely to satisfy tests.
